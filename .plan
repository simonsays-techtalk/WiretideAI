# Upcoming work (WiretideAI)
- [ ] Harden agent runner: config/state loading, timeouts, token recovery, structured logging, DRY_RUN flag.
- [ ] Implement register/status payload enrichment (SSH detection, board info, dns/ntp/firewall/clients sampling incl. WiFi associations).
- [ ] Flesh out config package handlers (firewall/apps/wifi/update) with UCI-safe, idempotent applies and rollback stubs.
- [ ] Package agent for OpenWrt (procd init, `/usr/bin/wiretide-agent-run`), plus local dry-run harness/tests.
